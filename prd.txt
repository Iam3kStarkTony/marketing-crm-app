Use ample white space to improve readability.
Consistency:
Consistent visual design, component placement, and interaction patterns across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
Consistent feedback mechanisms (loading indicators, success messages, error messages).
Information Prioritization:
Dashboards and primary views should highlight the most critical information first (e.g., urgent tasks, new messages, tasks awaiting client action).
Logical grouping of related information.
Feedback & Micro-interactions:
Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button presses, form submissions).
Use subtle animations to guide user attention and enhance engagement.
Mobile Optimization:
The React Native application must be fully responsive and optimized for both mobile (iOS, Android) and web interfaces, with touch-friendly controls and legible text sizes.
Prioritize key functionality for mobile access.
Accessibility:
Follow WCAG guidelines where feasible (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, clear focus states).
Provide alternative text for images.
Error Handling:
Clear, user-friendly error messages that explain the problem and suggest a solution.
Preventative measures where possible (e.g., input validation).
5.5. Maintainability
Code Quality: Adhere to best coding practices, clean code principles, and comprehensive documentation.
Modularity: Design components and services to be modular and loosely coupled to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes.
Automated Testing: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
5.6. Accessibility
Ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities where reasonably practicable, adhering to industry standards.

6. Technical Architecture & Stack
The application will leverage a modern, scalable, and real-time capable technology stack.
6.1. Frontend: React Native
Framework: React Native, ideally with Expo for streamlined development, over-the-air updates, and simplified build processes.
Platforms: iOS, Android, and Web (using Expo Web).
Reasoning: Enables cross-platform development with a single codebase, accelerating development time and ensuring consistent UI/UX across devices. Provides a native-like experience.
6.2. Backend: n8n
Role: Acts as the primary backend orchestration layer for business logic, workflow automation, and integrations.
Key Uses:
API Endpoints: Expose RESTful APIs for the React Native frontend to interact with (e.g., for CRUD operations on clients, tasks, messages).
Workflow Automation: Automate task reminders, client notifications (email, push), data synchronization, and potential future integrations with external services.
Data Processing: Perform any complex data transformations or validations before writing to Supabase.
AI Integration Orchestration: Connect to external AI APIs (e.g., for sentiment analysis on messages, content generation assistance) and process their outputs.
Reasoning: Visual workflow builder allows for rapid development of complex logic and integrations without extensive custom coding. Highly extensible.
6.3. Database: Supabase
Core Database: PostgreSQL.
Key Features Utilized:
Postgres Database: Robust, reliable, and feature-rich relational database for storing all client data, tasks, messages, user profiles, and file metadata.
Supabase Auth: Handles user authentication (email/password, potentially social logins in future phases) for both agency employees and clients.
Supabase Realtime: Provides real-time subscriptions for immediate updates in the UI (e.g., new chat messages, live task status changes).
Supabase Storage: Securely stores uploaded files (e.g., client assets, project documents).
Supabase Edge Functions: Lightweight, scalable serverless functions (written in TypeScript/JavaScript) for specific server-side logic, data transformations, or webhooks triggered by database events.
Reasoning: Offers a comprehensive backend-as-a-service solution with real-time capabilities, robust authentication, and storage, all built on top of a powerful PostgreSQL database, minimizing backend infrastructure management.
6.4. Key Integrations (via n8n and Supabase)
Push Notification Service:
Provider: Expo Push Notification Service (if using Expo) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) / Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) directly.
Integration: n8n workflows triggered by Supabase Webhooks (e.g., on tasks table updates) will send push notifications via the chosen service.
Email Service:
Provider: SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar transactional email service.
Integration: n8n workflows will integrate with this service to send email notifications and reminders to clients and internal teams.
AI Services (Future Consideration):
Provider: OpenAI (for GPT models), Google AI (for Gemini models), or specialized AI APIs.
Integration: n8n will serve as the middleware, calling these AI APIs based on specific triggers and feeding data from/to Supabase.
Dedicated Chat SDK/API (Future Consideration):
Provider: Stream Chat, Sendbird (for more advanced chat features like read receipts, complex presence, large-scale chat history).
Integration: While Supabase Realtime can handle basic chat, a specialized SDK might be integrated with the React Native app for a richer, more robust chat experience if basic real-time messaging proves insufficient. n8n could potentially orchestrate some aspects of this integration.
