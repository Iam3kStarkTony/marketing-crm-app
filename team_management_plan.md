# Team Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for adding Team Management functionality to the CRM application.

## Phase 1: Database & Backend Setup ✅ COMPLETED
### ✅ Tasks
- [x] **1.1** Review existing `profiles` table structure
- [x] **1.2** Verify `handle_new_user()` trigger functionality

### 📝 Phase 1 Summary
- **Profiles Table**: Perfect structure with id, email, full_name, role, department, is_active fields
- **Roles**: Three roles supported - admin, manager, agent (exactly what we need)
- **Auto Creation**: handle_new_user() trigger automatically creates profiles on signup
- **Sample Data**: add_developer_profile.sql ready for testing
- **Security**: RLS policies in place for profile creation
